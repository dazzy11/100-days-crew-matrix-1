Problems in your to-do list
CodeChef recently revamped its practice page to make it easier for users to identify the next problems they should solve by introducing some new features:
Recent Contest Problems - contains only problems from the last 2 contests
Separate Un-Attempted, Attempted, and All tabs
Problem Difficulty Rating - the Recommended dropdown menu has various difficulty ranges so that you can attempt the problems most suited to your experience

Like most users, Chef didn’t know that he could add problems to a personal to-do list by clicking on the magic '+' symbol on the top-right of each problem page. But once he found out about it, he went crazy and added loads of problems to his to-do list without looking at their difficulty rating.Chef is a beginner and should ideally try and solve only problems with difficulty rating strictly less than 
1000. Given a list of difficulty ratings for problems in the Chef’s to-do list, please help him identify how many of those problems Chef should remove from his to-do list, so that he is only left with problems of difficulty rating less than1000.
